Web Scraper

I take no responsibility and I hope that you will use this code for your own interests when using it.

This Python code is designed to fetch data from a website using requests and BeautifulSoup libraries.
Firstly, the URL of the website from which data will be fetched is assigned to the url variable using the requests library,
and a GET request is sent to the website using the requests.get() method. Then, the response variable is assigned the response from the website.
Next, the BeautifulSoup library is used to parse the HTML code of the website and assign it to the soup variable.
The title variable is created by taking the title information from the HTML code in the soup variable.
The text variable, on the other hand, is created by taking the text content of the website using the soup.get_text() method.
Finally, the obtained data is printed to the screen using the print() function.
This code can be used to print the title and text content of the website in the given url variable. 
However, before running this code, make sure that the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries are installed.

To adapt this code to your own website, you just need to assign the URL of the website you want to scrape to the "url" variable and use Beautiful 
Soup's "find" or "find_all" methods to extract data from the website. 
However, web scraping may be illegal and unethical if your website's sitemaps.xml or robots.txt files prohibit web scraping or if the website's
terms of use prohibit data scraping.
